## Inspiration

We all want to live and work in spaces that are healthy, clean, and well-maintained. Cleaning products help in that pursuit. They remove dust, allergens, and germs from our indoor environment. Have you ever considered the environmental and health impacts of the cleaning chemicals?

Commercial use of cleaning products affect the indoor and outdoor environment and can lead to pollution and waste. 

Water Pollution – Thousands of chemicals from cleaning products are washed into streams and rivers. Some persist in the environment and enter the food chain. 
 
Air Pollution – Volatile organic compounds (VOC) in cleaning products can affect indoor air quality and add to outdoor smog. Plus, transportation leads to carbon emissions from trucks.
 
Waste – Many containers are not made from recyclable materials. Packaging and empty bottles often end up in landfills. Hazardous materials may have a special requirement which usually requires energy for transport and disposal. 


And with Covid-19 this is only getting worse since we're using more and more cleaning products and a lot of businesses are only using single use plastic.
The pandemic is really affecting all of us and we need to stay safe and protect ourselves, but we also need to protect our world and our environment by being more environmentally conscious.

## What it does

Keep It Green app is an AR application that enables users to scan household items (Such as Cleaning Products) and get ratings and information about how sustainable the household item is. If the item is not sustainable, The app plays a buzzer sound and shows you alternative brands that you can buy nearby. If the item is eco-friendly, the app will give more information about the initiatives the brand is taking to stay environmentally sustainable and also suggest items to buy along with it.

The home page includes tips on how to be more eco-friendly.
and there is also a not fully developed store feature.

## How we built it

We are a team of 2 sisters. A big sister and a younger sister. I, the big sister, focused on implementing the AR feature using a combination of Vuforia and EchoAR. The app was built and implemented using Unity and C#.
We worked together on the whole project but I'm also really proud to say that my little sister built a website for the time ever fully by herself so please check it out --- https://meleksaid2.wixsite.com/website-2

We're using Google FireBase for Authentication.

I also used photoshop to cut the logos from the product's images.

## Challenges we ran into

I'm using EchoAR for the first time for a project and I had to learn how to connect it with Unity and display objects. 
I also had a problem that took hours of work which was all of the UI element disspearing from my project and I had to learn how to reimport the package and fix the UI.
It was also very challenging to push the project to the android phone. I had so many errors but in the end managed to get over it.

It was also really challenging to use photoshop to get the logos out of the products' images as I barely have any experience using photoshop.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I'm extremely proud that my sister just attended her first hackathon ever and learned a lot from workshops and was able to build a website for the project by herseld. We also both really learned a lot more about the effect of our habbits on the planet.

I'm proud that I was able to set up firebase so fast 1'

## What we learned

I'm participating at this hackathon with my little sister ! she learned a lot ! This is her first hackathon ever and she just started learning how to code a couple weeks ago. She learned how to use several software and most importantly she made a full website for our project by herself ! 

I learned how to use EchoAR ! and I also learned how to get over all of the android dependencies problems and finally be able to push the project to my phone and test it at the super market. 

## What's next for Keep It Green

lot and lots of other products !! I want to add as much products as possible to make the app very beneficial.
I also want to extend of the shop feature by actually adding payment method through the app and I would also like to add a map feature.
